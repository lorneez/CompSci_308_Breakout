Lorne Zhang

Dates: 1/9 – 1/19 

Time spent: 100 hours
1. I mainly used the JavaFX tutorial provided on the course website.
2. Files used to start the program: None
3. Classes used in the program:
Ball, BrickHeavy, PowerUp
3. Files used to test the program:
TestReader – used to test the creation of levels by testing 
4. Additional files for the project:
W – win level, Q – lose level, L – gain a life, S – increase ball strength by 1, 1-3 – go to levels 1-3
5. Extra features included in the program:
moving blocks, blinking levels
6. First impressions to improve the project:
At first, it was extremely intimidating because I had little to no experience coding in Java. Some more resources about Java object classes, extends, implements, and interfaces would have been useful.
