### Breakout Variant
I thought Jet Ball was interesting because it includes blocks that are moving around. This allows the creator to create different difficulties in their levels by changing the paths and speeds of the moving blocks.

### General Level Descriptions
Level 1: Basic breakout in a rectangular layout with a few moving blocks on the edges.

Level 2: Every layer of the rectangular layout is moving horizontally in the opposite direction as the layers above and below it.

Final Level: Blocks are moving faster and some are in a circle while others are horizontal.

### Bricks Ideas
Brick 1: Normal brick that takes 1 hit to break.

Brick 2: Tougher bricks that take anywhere from 2-4 hits to break.

Brick 3: Bricks that move (circular and horizontally).

Brick 4: Bricks that drop power ups or more balls.

### Power Up Ideas

Power Up 1: Double damage (removes 2 durability off any block hit). Lasts 20 seconds.

Power Up 2: 3 Balls (spawns 3 balls into play).

Power Up 3: Invincibility (if you miss a ball, no lives are lost). Lasts 30 seconds. 

### Cheat Key Ideas

Cheat Key 1 (S): Spam balls (balls are spawned in).

Cheat Key 2 (F): Freeze (freeze all moving blocks).

Cheat Key 3 (W): Win! (win the level).

Cheat Key 4 (L): add additional lives to the player.

Cheat Key 5 (R): resets the ball and paddle to their starting position.

Cheat Key 6 (1-9): when the player presses a numeric key, clear the current level and jump to the level corresponding to the number pressed (or the highest one that exists).

### Something Extra

Blinking bricks. Some of the bricks will blink in and out of existence. They can still be hit and eliminated when invisible, but they will make the level harder to complete due to the fact that some of the bricks will be moving. This is a substantial addition because it adds a level of complexity to the game that inspires the player to work harder and predict the locations of the blocks when they turn invisible.
